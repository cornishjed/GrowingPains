## Growing Pains

Write a program that reads 5 int values (must be between 0-9) from the user and then
combines them into a single 5 digit int value, e.g. 1,2,3,4,5 => 12345. Output this value
to the screen and then reverse the process by turning the same 5 digit int value back
into 5 separate int values which should be output to the screen in the following format:
12345 => 1,2,3,4,5
